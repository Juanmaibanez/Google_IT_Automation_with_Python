# Welcome to the Course

### Welcome to the course!

In this course, you’ll learn how to use Python to perform system administration tasks and interact with a computer’s operating system. You’re about to embark on an exciting journey to learn one of the most-in-demand job skills in IT today!

### Course prerequisites
This course builds upon the contents taught in the introduction to Python course:

* The basic Python syntax (if, for, while, defining functions, classes, and methods)

* How to use the most common data structures (strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries)

* How to import and use additional Python modules

This course also requires some familiarity with some basic operating system concepts:

* Files, directories, and file systems

* Processes

* Log files

To get the most out of this course, we strongly recommend that you install software in your machine, or have your system administrator install it.

### Finding out more information

Throughout this course, we teach you how to do a range of things with Python, Bash, and other tools. While we’ll provide a lot of information through videos and supplemental readings, sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own, now and throughout your career. Things change fast in IT, so it’s critical to do your own research to stay up-to-date on what’s new. We recommend you use your favorite search engine to find more information about concepts we cover in this course — it’s great practice for the real world!

On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): This book (available online and in print) includes a lot of practical programming exercises for beginners. You can refer to this content to read more about some of the things that we'll be discussing, and get inspired with more ideas of things that can be automated.

* [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/): This site (available online and in print) also covers a lot of what we can do with Python. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about the subjects we cover (and the ones we had to omit for time constraints).

* The [official language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html): Once you know what Python tool you'll be using to do a certain task, this technical reference of all Python language components can be a great
