# Study Guide: Expressions and Variables

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In the Expressions and Variables segment, you learned about expressions, variables, and the data types: string, integer, and float. You learned how to convert a value from one data type to another and you learned how to resolve a few common errors in Python.

## Terms

* **expression** - a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated

* **data types** - classes of data (e.g., string, int, float, Boolean, etc.), which include the properties and behaviors of instances of the data type (variables)

* **variable** - an instance of a data type class, represented by a unique name within the code, that stores changeable values of the specific data type

* **implicit conversion** - when the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another

* **explicit conversion** - when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:

    * **str()** - converts a value (often numeric) to a **string** data type

    * **int()** - converts a value (usually a float) to an **integer** data type

    * **float()** - converts a value (usually an integer) to a **float** data type
