**Study Guide: Week 4 Graded Quiz**

 >It is time to prepare for the Week 4 Graded Quiz. Please review the following items from this module before beginning the quiz. If you would like to refresh your memory on these materials, please also revisit the Study Guides located before each practice quiz in Week 4: 
>Study Guide: Strings, Study Guide: Lists Operations and Methods, and Study Guide: Dictionary Methods.

-------------------------------------------------

**Knowledge**

>How to output a list of the keys in a Python dictionary. 

>How to determine the output of a string index range used on a string.

>Determine what a list should contain after the .insert() method is used on the list.

>How to replace a specific word in a sentence with the same word in all uppercase letters.

>How to use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in a string.

**Reminder: Correct syntax is critical**

>Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. 

>No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.  

>Now, before starting the graded quiz, please review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code.

**Common syntax errors:**

* Misspellings

* Incorrect indentations

* Missing or incorrect key characters:

    * Parenthetical types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }

    * Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’

    * Block introduction characters, like colons - :

    * Data type mismatches

    * Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words

    * Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language
