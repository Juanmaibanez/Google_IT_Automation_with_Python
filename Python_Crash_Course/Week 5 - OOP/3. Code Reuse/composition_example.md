Let’s expand a bit on our Clothing classes from the previous in-video question. Your mission: Finish the "Stock_by_Material" method and iterate over the amount of each item of a given material that is in stock. When you’re finished, the script should add up to 10 cotton clothing items.

```python
class Clothing:
  stock={ 'name': [],'material' :[], 'amount':[]}
  def __init__(self,name):
    material = ""
    self.name = name
  def add_item(self, name, material, amount):
    Clothing.stock['name'].append(self.name)
    Clothing.stock['material'].append(self.material)
    Clothing.stock['amount'].append(amount)
  def Stock_by_Material(self, material):
    count=0
    n=0
    for item in Clothing.stock['___']:
      if item == material:
        count += Clothing.___['amount'][n]
        n+=1
    return count

class shirt(Clothing):
  material="Cotton"
class pants(Clothing):
  material="Cotton"
  
polo = shirt("Polo")
sweatpants = pants("Sweatpants")
polo.add_item(polo.name, polo.material, 4)
sweatpants.add_item(sweatpants.name, sweatpants.material, 6)
current_stock = polo.Stock_by_Material("Cotton")
print(current_stock)
```

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. To fix the issues and make the script add up to 10 cotton clothing items, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
class Clothing:
    stock = {'name': [], 'material': [], 'amount': []}

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def add_item(self, name, material, amount):
        Clothing.stock['name'].append(name)
        Clothing.stock['material'].append(material)
        Clothing.stock['amount'].append(amount)

    def Stock_by_Material(self, material):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(Clothing.stock['name'])):
            if Clothing.stock['material'][i] == material:
                count += Clothing.stock['amount'][i]
        return count


class shirt(Clothing):
    material = "Cotton"


class pants(Clothing):
    material = "Cotton"


polo = shirt("Polo")
sweatpants = pants("Sweatpants")
polo.add_item(polo.name, polo.material, 4)
sweatpants.add_item(sweatpants.name, sweatpants.material, 6)
current_stock = polo.Stock_by_Material("Cotton")
print(current_stock)
```
    10

In the updated code, the `Stock_by_Material` method is modified to iterate over the `Clothing.stock` dictionary using the `range` function and the length of the `name` list. It checks if the material of each item matches the given material and adds the corresponding amount to the `count` variable.

The `add_item` method is modified to correctly append the `name`, `material`, and `amount` to the `Clothing.stock` dictionary.

The `shirt` and `pants` classes are defined as subclasses of the `Clothing` class, inheriting its methods and attributes. The `material` attribute is set to "Cotton" for both classes.

The `polo` and `sweatpants` objects are created as instances of the `shirt` and `pants` classes, respectively. The `add_item` method is called on each object to add the items to the stock.

Finally, the `Stock_by_Material` method is called on the `polo` object with the argument "Cotton", and the result is printed, which should be 10 in this case.
