On top of search results, here are some good programming resources available online:

The official [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial is designed to help people teach themselves Python. While it goes in a different order than the one we're taking here, it covers a lot of the same subjects that we explore in this course. You can refer to this resource for extra information on these subjects.

The [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) book. This book aims to teach people how to program in Python. It's available online in PDF and browsable forms. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about some of the subjects we cover.

The [official language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). This is a technical reference of all Python language components. At first, this resource might be a little too complex, but as you learn how Python works and how itâ€™s built, this can be a useful reference to understand the details of these interactions.
