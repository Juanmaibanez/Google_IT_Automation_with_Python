4. The fiel_date function creates a new file in the current working directory, checks the date that the file was modified, and returns just the date portion of the timestamp in the format of yyyy-mm-dd. Fill in the gaps to create a file called "newfile.txt" and check the date that it was modified.

```python
import os
import datetime

def file_date(filename):
  # Create the file in the current directory
  ___
  timestamp = ___
  # Convert the timestamp into a readable format, then into a string
  ___
  # Return just the date portion 
  # Hint: how many characters are in “yyyy-mm-dd”? 
  return ("{___}".format(___))

print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
# Should be today's date in the format of yyyy-mm-dd
```

Here's the completed code:

```python
import os
import datetime

def file_date(filename):
  # Create the file in the current directory
  open(filename, 'w').close()
  # Get the timestamp when the file was modified
  timestamp = os.path.getmtime(filename)
  # Convert the timestamp into a readable format, then into a string
  date = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).date()
  # Return just the date portion
  return date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
# Should be today's date in the format of yyyy-mm-dd
```

This code creates a new file called "newfile.txt" in the current working directory using the `open()` function with the mode set to `'w'` (write mode). Then, it retrieves the timestamp of when the file was last modified using the `os.path.getmtime()` function. The timestamp is converted into a readable format using `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()` and then formatted as a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" using `date.strftime()`. Finally, the formatted date is returned.

```
Error on line 14:
    print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
Error on line 6:
    open(filename, 'w').close()
OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: 'newfile.txt'
```

The error message suggests that you are trying to create the file "newfile.txt" in a read-only file system, which does not allow writing or creating new files. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Make sure you have write permissions in the current working directory or the directory where you are trying to create the file.
2. Check if the file system is read-only. If it is, you may need to change the permissions or choose a different directory where you have write access.
3. Verify that the file "newfile.txt" does not already exist in the directory. If it does, you may need to choose a different filename or delete the existing file before running the code again.

Once you have resolved the issue with creating the file, you can run the code again to check the modified date.

If you are encountering an "OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system" error, it means that the current file system is read-only and does not allow creating or modifying files. In such a case, you can modify the code to check the modified date of an existing file instead. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
import os
import datetime

def file_date(filename):
  # Check if the file exists
  if os.path.exists(filename):
    # Get the timestamp when the file was last modified
    timestamp = os.path.getmtime(filename)
    # Convert the timestamp into a readable format, then into a string
    date = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).date()
    # Return just the date portion
    return date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  else:
    return "File does not exist"

print(file_date("existingfile.txt")) 
# Should be the modified date of the existing file in the format of yyyy-mm-dd

print(file_date("newfile.txt")) 
# Should print "File does not exist" since the file does not exist
```

In this updated code, the `file_date` function first checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`. If the file exists, it retrieves the timestamp of when the file was last modified using `os.path.getmtime()`. The timestamp is then converted into a readable format and returned as a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". If the file does not exist, it returns the message "File does not exist".

You can now use this code to check the modified date of an existing file.
